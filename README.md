This project is based on Lego Mindstorms and was developed at the RWTH Aachen University. Our team consisted of three members, and we worked for a total of 7.5 hours over four days. The project involved building a robot, named "Mo," using the Lego Mindstorms set. We used Matlab as the programming language for this project, and we had no prior experience with Matlab before starting the project. Therefore, the code may not be as dry as it could be, but we made use of the toolbox provided by the university.

The aim of this project was to develop a robot that could perform a set of tasks autonomously. We utilized the sensors provided by the Lego Mindstorms set to help the robot navigate and perform some tasks.

We have provided videos and photos of Mo in action. The videos can be found at the following links:
