I am sharing the codes of the project we did at the university.
Completely matlab used. We built our robot named Mo with the lego mindstorms set,
we worked 7.5 hours in 4 days with a group of 3 people. We didn't have any matlab 
experience before so the code is not very dry. In addition, the tool box shared with us 
by rwth aachen university was used. You can find videos and photos about how the robot works.
